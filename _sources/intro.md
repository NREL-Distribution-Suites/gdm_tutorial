# Welcome to the Grid-Data-Models (GDM) Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore the key features of the Grid Data Models (GDM) package. These features include the Pydantic validation layer, time series data management, unit conversion, and JSON serialization and deserialization. Additionally, we will cover how to interact with and update a GDM system, work with the underlying graph representation, track changes against a base model, and perform model reduction.
