    "# The GDM Package\n",
    "\n",
    "GDM is a Python package containing data models for distribution system assets and datasets. This package is actively being developed at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Grid Data Models?\n",
    "Distribution models typically contain many components, making them difficult to explore and to resolve modeling errors.  Developing \"one-off\" data models for tools leads to code duplicaton and limits code extensibility.  Using a single data model for tool development can help.  Additionally, GDM has several features can help with the development of distribution modeling tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Validation Layer:** The use of [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) allows for the validation of data models.\n",
    "- **Time Series Data Management:** GDM uses the [infrasys](https://github.nrel.gov/CADET/infrastructure_systems) package, enabling [efficient time series data management](https://nrel.github.io/infrasys/explanation/time_series.html) by sharing arrays across components and offloading system memory. For example, time series power consumption data can be attached to a load profile.\n",
    "- **Built-in Unit Conversion:** GDM leverages [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for unit conversion of power system quantities, such as power, voltage, and time.\n",
    "- **JSON Serialization/Deserialization:** GDM uses [infrasys](https://github.com/NREL/infrasys) to serialize and deserialize distribution system components to/from JSON.\n",
    "- **Track System Changes:** Supports tracking changes within a distribution model (both temporal and scenario-based static updates), enabling powerful scenario management capabilities.\n",
    "- **Graph-Based Analysis:** Exposes a connectivity graph using NetworkX, allowing advanced graph-based algorithms and visualizations.\n",
    "- **Model Reduction:** Built-in support for multiple model reduction algorithms.\n",
    "- **Interoperability:** GDM is used by several NREL distribution modeling tools, which enables coordinated workflows between tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The GDM Ecosystem\n",
    "The following tools currently use GDM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grid-Data-Models:** Foundational model for distribution system analysis.\n",
    "- **Shift:** Builds synthetic distribution models and uses the GDM data model.\n",
    "- **DiTTo:** Tool for converting between inputs for different distribution powerflow solvers, using GDM as the interal data model.\n",
    "- **ERAD:** Resilience analysis for distribution systems, using hazard and GDM models as inputs.\n",
    "- **CADET:** Distribution system optimization frameworks.\n",
    "- **GridAI:** Builds training datasets for PyTorch for generative AI applications from GDM base models.\n",
    "- **DistDB:** Distribution asset cost database, currently being built, will map to GDM equipment models.\n",
    "- **DistLLM:** LLM interface for the entire distribution suite ecosystem.\n",
